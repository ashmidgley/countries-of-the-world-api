## Contributing
Cheers for your interest in the project! Pull requests are welcome for any level of improvement, although before contributing new features please keep in mind that the goal was to create a **simple** map quiz so any unnecessarily complex changes probably wont be merged. The general guidelines I'll follow are:
* :+1: Refactoring of my dodgy Go.
* :+1: Bug fixes.
* :+1: New features that match changes to the front end.

If you are thinking about working on something, feel free to make an issue beforehand so that you can make sure it'll be worth your time!
